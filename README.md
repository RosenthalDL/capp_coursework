- Markovian Candidate
  - _Overview:_ For this assignment I developed a modeling system using Markov models which could determine which of two speakers was more likely for a given piece of text. Markov models can be used to capture the statistical relationships present in a language like English. A second piece of this assignment was to build a custom hash table module to contain the text elements. This hash table module implemented a linear probing algorithm and also allowed for rehashing when necessary and adjusting for the deletion of records.  
  - _Topics:_ hash tables, linear probing, abstract classes, generating modules
- Scraping Chicago Parks Site
  - _Overview:_ As part of this assignment I built a scraper that crawls a simulacrum of the Chicago Parks website to construct a search index. The assignment gave me experience building a real-world crawler that works with HTML documents as well as additional practice composing a Python application.
  - _Topics:_ HTTP requests, web scraping, CSS selectors, data formats, HTML parsing 
- Search Engine
  - _Overview:_ I developed a basic search engine utilizing the data of Chicago public parks collected via the previous web scraping assignment. I accomplished this task by writing complex queries in SQLite, and working with regular expressions to improve data matching and query accruacy. The search application also included a function which utilized a [haversine distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haversine_formula) to filter search results based on proximity to a given location. My code further went into a web interface for searching the database built with Flask, giving me a more robust understanding of how backend data work interacts with a final user interface. 
  - _Topics:_ SQL queries, regular expressions
- Data Cleaning & Linkage
- Decision Tree
